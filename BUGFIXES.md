## Remaining Issues:
3. Bot zar atmıyo (bazen)
5. Zar attım ileri yerine geri gitti
8. Kicklenince oyun donuyor (2 kişi kalınca)
20. Kendi yerine gelince kira ödüyor (race condition)

## NEW BUGS TO FIX (User Reported):
15. ✅ **Trade reddetme çalışmıyor** - Added 500ms delay to prevent race condition, added trade ID logging
16. ✅ **Trade sonrası turn end olmuyor** - acceptTrade() now sets turnState='action_complete' if current player involved
17. ✅ **Bazen roll dice/end turn yapamıyor** - Fixed all game flows to properly set turnState='action_complete' instead of calling endTurn() directly. Added 5-second safety check to force action_complete if stuck in 'rolled' state.
18. ✅ **Bot oyuncu yerine zar atıyor** - Added triple bot validation: validates isBot before turn, sets isBotTurnInProgress lock, double-checks after delay
19. ✅ **İflas etmiş oyuncuya pop-up geliyor** - checkPendingTrades() now filters out bankrupt players (myPlayer.isBankrupt check)
20. ❌ **Kendi yerine gelince kira ödüyor (race condition)** - Log'da hem "no rent" hem "paid rent" görünüyor

### Button Blocking Fix (Bug #17) (✅ FIXED)
**Problem**: Roll Dice and End Turn buttons sometimes became unresponsive because various game actions weren't properly setting `turnState` to `'action_complete'`.

**Root Cause**: Multiple game flows (rent payment, tax payment, card drawing, jail, auctions, etc.) were calling the `endTurn()` async function instead of directly setting `turnState='action_complete'`. The `endTurn()` function had early returns that didn't set turnState, and it would sometimes set it to 'start' instead of 'action_complete' (for doubles).

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Own Property Landing** (line ~4704): Changed from auto-calling `endTurn()` to just setting `turnState='action_complete'`
2. **Free Parking** (line ~4716): Changed from `setTimeout(() => endTurn(), 1000)` to `await updateGame({ turnState: 'action_complete' })`
3. **Rent Payment** (lines ~5722, ~5754, ~5781):
   - Bot rent: Sets `turnState='action_complete'` after payment
   - Human rent: Sets `turnState='action_complete'` after modal closes
   - Zero rent: Sets `turnState='action_complete'` immediately
4. **Tax Payment** (lines ~5929, ~5950):
   - Bot tax: Sets `turnState='action_complete'` after payment
   - Human tax: Sets `turnState='action_complete'` after modal closes
5. **Card Drawing** (lines ~5811, ~5902, ~5909):
   - No cards: Sets `turnState='action_complete'`
   - Bot cards: Sets `turnState='action_complete'` for auto-close cards
   - Human cards: Sets `turnState='action_complete'` when modal closes
6. **Go To Jail** (line ~5803): Sets `turnState='action_complete'` when sent to jail
7. **Jail Actions** (lines ~6014, ~6017, ~6029):
   - Roll for jail (success/fail): Both set `turnState='action_complete'`
   - Pay jail fine: Sets `turnState='action_complete'`
8. **Auction End** (line ~5694): Sets `turnState='action_complete'` after auction completes
9. **Safety Mechanism** in `updateControls()` (line ~4196): Added 5-second timeout detection - if turnState is stuck in 'rolled' for >5s, automatically forces it to 'action_complete'

**Result**: All game actions now properly enable the End Turn button by setting turnState to 'action_complete'. The safety mechanism prevents permanent button blocking if any edge case is missed.
